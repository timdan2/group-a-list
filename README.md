group-a-list
============

Project to group any given list into a given number of nearly-equal-sized groupings.

I currently work at a school, and this task comes to me quite frequently:

We have a list of students (or staff members), we would like to create X number of nearly-equal-sized groups,
and we would like the students to be assigned to the groups randomly.

I have done this many different ways, using some combination of various tools, including Filemaker Pro, MS Excel, 
and online randomizers.

This is the start of my attempt to create a single tool that would allow the user to paste a simple list into a text box
and specify the number of groups they want the list divided into.

The Groupings.java file currently contains the logic needed.  Next, I'll be creating a GUI front-end.

Test2.
